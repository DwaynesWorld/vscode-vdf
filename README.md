Adds language support for VDF to Visual Studio Code.

Supports:

- code completion

## TODO

- Get Unit Testing and Travis CI setup
- error squiggles and apply suggestions from errors
- types and documentation on hover
- find all references
- symbol search
- build tasks
- refactoring (rename, extract to method)
- Lots more...

## Known issues

- regex needs some help, does not find methods with array brackets in declaration correctly
